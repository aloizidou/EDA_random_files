# US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores a dataset of US accidents covering 49 states from February 2016 to December 2020. Using Python and pandas, I performed exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in accident frequency by state, city, time of day, and month.

## Key Findings

* California and Florida have the highest accident counts.
* Most cities reported fewer than 100 accidents; a few populous cities dominate total counts.
* Accident rates peak during weekday rush hours and show seasonal variations.
* Columns like 'Precipitation' have high missing values and require careful treatment.

## Next Steps

* Deeper analysis of year-over-year trends.
* Potential modeling on how weather conditions impact accident rates.
